    <p id="tribute-info" class="pres-info" >Rodrigo Roa Duterte KGCR (/dəˈtɜːrteɪ/; Tagalog: [roˈdɾigo ɾowa dʊˈtɛɾtɛ] (listen); born March 28, 1945), also known as Digong, Rody and by the initials PRRD, is a Filipino lawyer and politician who is the 16th and outgoing incumbent president of the Philippines. He is the chairperson of PDP–Laban, the ruling political party in the Philippines. Duterte is the first president of the Philippines to be from Mindanao, and is the oldest, beginning his term at age 71; the record was previously held by Sergio Osmeña at the age of 65.

Born in Maasin, Leyte (now in Southern Leyte), Duterte moved to Davao as a child where his father, Vicente Duterte, served as provincial governor. He studied political science at the Lyceum of the Philippines University, graduating in 1968, before obtaining a law degree from San Beda College of Law in 1972. He then worked as a lawyer and was a prosecutor for Davao City, before becoming vice mayor and, subsequently, mayor of the city in the wake of the 1986 People Power Revolution. Duterte won seven terms and served as mayor of Davao for over 22 years, during which he transformed the once crime-ridden city to a peaceful and investor-friendly city.</p>
